This project is about testing my knowledge that i have attained over past few lessons on html and put them into practice over a simple project

The project is to create a basic recipe website with links redirecting to different pages that contain their own recipe details and instructions.

I have been able to make full use of the syntax that i have learnt in past lessons such as 
-Adding images, describing the images(alt attribute) and resizing them
-Making text embedded with links redirecting to my other html files (pages)
-Using unordered list and ordered list
-Writing Paragraphs to describe the recipe with the use of <p>

I cam confidently say i gained good experience through this project with repetition on html boilerplate and common syntax and helped me further understand parent child relationship between elements.
