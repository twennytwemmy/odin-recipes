This project was about testing the knowledge I have gained over the past few lessons in HTML and applying it in a simple project.

The goal was to create a basic recipe website with links that lead to different pages, each containing its own recipe details and instructions.

I was able to make full use of the HTML syntax Iâ€™ve learned, such as:

Adding images, describing them using the alt attribute, and resizing them

Embedding links in text to navigate between my HTML pages

Using unordered and ordered lists

Using <p> tags to write paragraphs describing each recipe

I can confidently say that this project gave me valuable experience. Repeated practice with the HTML boilerplate and common syntax helped me better understand how elements relate to each other, especially the parent-child relationships in HTML structure.
